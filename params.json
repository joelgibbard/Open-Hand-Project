{"name":"Open-hand-project","tagline":"Dexterity without prosperity","body":"The aim of the Open Hand Project is to make robotic prosthetic hands more accessible to amputees.\r\n\r\nLeading prosthetics can cost up to $100,000. By using emerging technologies like 3D printing, we can cut that down to under $1000. Thatâ€™s two orders of magnitude cheaper, and means that these devices can reach a far broader audience!\r\n\r\nThe Open Hand Project is open source and created under the GNU public license V3.0","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
